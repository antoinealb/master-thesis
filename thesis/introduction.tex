\chapter{Introduction}

Since the introduction of computing systems, the amount of data to process have steadily increased.
Historically, companies used larger and larger servers to cope with the increasing load.
In recent years however, it became clear that switching to large amount of unreliable, commodity servers was the most economical solution.
Not only was the hardware for this approach cheaper, it also helped with avaibility.
If a server component had to be replaced, it could simply be taken offline while the rest of the server handled requests.

Unfortunately, switching to this distributed model of computation also created new problems.
The biggest of all was the issue of data consistency: ensuring that node A and B had the same view of the world proved difficult.
And when the network or machines in it are not reliable, it only becomes more difficult.
This is called the \emph{distributed consensus problem} and algorithms to solve it are part of almost any modern large scale system.

Traditionally, consensus algorithms have been part of the application layer and run on top of existing transport protocols.
While this is easier to implement, it also means each distributed application must re-implement the consensus protocol which is hard to get right.
Imagine if each application had its own implementation of reliable, in-order transport?

From this observation, we decided to implement the consensus protocol at the transport layer.
This means each application gets the possibility to become distributed ``for free''.
We implemented this as part of our \gls{rpc} oriented transport, which runs on top of UDP.

Chapter \ref{chap:background} provides some background about consensus algorithms and transports.
Chapter~\ref{chap:design} describes our protocol design, while Chapter~\ref{chap:implementation} describes the reference implementation.
Finally, Chapter~\ref{chap:evaluation} contains our evaluation of the system's performance under various loads.
