\section{Disk backed persistency}

\section{Max-latency batching}

Random idea: Currently requests are either immediately replicated to the log or we wait for a configurable timeout to expire, then send a batch of request.
This could lead to bad behaviour in heavily loaded servers (many small appendrequests) or create timeouts that are too important for the application.
Maybe a smart batching policy is possible and should be designed in the protocol.

\section{Consistency verification of the protocol}

Jepsen\cite{jepsen} is an automated tool for checking of consistency properties in distributed systems.
It works by randomly applying partitions, delays and packet reordering to distributed applications.
So far it sucessfuly analyzed big open source project such as MongoDB, etcd, or Redis.
We think we would gain a lot of confidence in the soundness of our implementation if a Jepsen testbench was available for it.
It could be written using \gls{r2p2} as its only interface, so that the same test suite could be shared between many different \gls{r2p2} implementations.
