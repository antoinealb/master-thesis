    Consensus protocol have seen increased usage in recent years due to the industry shift to distributed computing.
    However, it has traditionaly been implemented in the application layer.
    We propose to move the consensus protocol in the transport layer, to offer reliable ordered delivery of messages to applications.

    Our implementation builds on R2P2, a novel RPC framework for datacenter applications.
    It can run both using a Linux UDP socket or kernel bypass using DPDK.
    We observe tail latency increase of only \SI{10}{\micro\second} and a throughput loss of only 13\% compared to the unreplicated application, showing that easy-to-use consensus can also have high performance.
